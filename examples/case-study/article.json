  "subtitle": "The product decisions, design obsessions, and go-to-market bets that turned a crowded market into a $10M revenue engine",
  "summary": "When Karri Saarinen and Tuomas Artman left Airbnb to build yet another issue tracker, investors were skeptical. Jira dominated. GitHub Issues was free. But Linear's obsession with speed, keyboard-first design, and developer experience created a product so loved that teams switched without being asked. This case study traces Linear's journey from a two-person prototype to $10M ARR, examining the specific product decisions, growth loops, and counterintuitive bets that made it happen.",

    "hook": "In a market where Jira held 70%+ share and GitHub Issues was free, two ex-Airbnb engineers bet everything on speed and taste. Four years later, Linear hit $10M ARR with almost zero outbound sales.",
    "tension": "Building a project management tool in 2019 looked like a death wish. The market was saturated, switching costs were high, and Atlassian had a decade head start. Linear needed a fundamentally different approach to even survive.",
    "resolution": "By treating performance as a feature, designing for keyboard-native workflows, and letting product-led growth do the selling, Linear built a tool that spread organically through engineering teams at companies like Vercel, Ramp, and Loom.",
    "transformation": "From a crowded commodity market to a premium brand that developers actively choose and champion internally"
