# Research: The Fastest App Nobody Expected

## Founders Background
- Karri Saarinen: Principal Designer & co-creator of design systems at Airbnb. Previously co-founded a YC startup sold to Coinbase. First designer at Kippt (YC-backed) and Coinbase.
- Tuomas Artman: One of the most respected mobile software engineers at Uber. Had built sync engines for over a decade at Groupon and Uber before Linear.
- Jori Lallo: Early role at Coinbase after co-founding the YC startup with Saarinen.
- All three co-founded Linear in 2019.

## The Jira Chrome Extension Origin
- At Airbnb, Saarinen created a Chrome extension to simplify Jira that "took Airbnb's product team by storm"
- This was the seed of the insight: existing tools were fundamentally broken for makers

## Performance Data
- Linear achieves sub-50ms response times for creating issues
- Jira typically takes 1-2 seconds for the same operations
- Linear page load times: under 100ms for board views, issue details, project switching
- Jira page loads: 1-5 seconds
- Linear performed 3.7x faster than Jira and 2.3x faster than Asana for common operations (2024 benchmark)

## Early Traction
- Private beta picked up hundreds of companies including Pitch, Render, Albert, Curology, Spoke, Compound, and YC startups
- Built a 10,000-person waitlist through Twitter following
- Sequoia partner approached them because "people she trusts in her Twitter network were hyped about Linear"

## Key Quotes
- Karri on founding motivation: experienced strong negative sentiment toward Jira at Airbnb
- Tuomas Artman challenges the traditional MVP approach: in a competitive market, you need to build something better from the start
