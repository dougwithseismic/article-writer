# Research: The Problem Hiding in Plain Sight

## Founder Frustrations
- Saarinen noticed "strong negative sentiment" toward Jira at Airbnb
- Built Chrome extension to simplify Jira; it spread virally through Airbnb's product team
- Jori Lallo and Tuomas Artman had identical frustrations at Coinbase and Uber
- Key insight: companies had evolved their dev processes, but the tools hadn't

## Jira's Evolution into Bloatware
- Jira became a tool designed for managers and process consultants, not engineers
- Excessive required fields made every interaction slower
- Customization options created cognitive overload
- Teams spent more time managing workflows than building software
- Performance degraded with scale

## Developer Flow State Research
- Gloria Mark (UC Irvine): takes 23 minutes on average to refocus after an interruption
- Programmer takes 10-15 minutes to resume editing code after interruption
- Productivity decreases up to 40% with frequent interruptions
- McKinsey: developers spend only 41% of workday in productive flow state
- Interrupted tasks take twice as long and contain twice as many errors
- Harvard Business Review: knowledge workers need average 52 minutes of uninterrupted work to reach flow

## The Gap
- Tools were bought by procurement/management, used by developers
- What managers wanted (configurability, reporting, audit trails) conflicted with what engineers needed (speed, simplicity, keyboard-first)
- Jira had a decade head start and enormous switching costs
- Every developer knew the pain but assumed it was unsolvable

## The Insight
- Speed itself could be a feature, not just a metric
- An opinionated tool built FOR developers could win bottom-up even against enterprise procurement
