# Research: What Linear Teaches Every Product Builder

## Product Philosophy (from interviews)
- "Design something for someone, not for everyone" - Karri Saarinen
- "You can't build the optimal tool if it's very flexible or endlessly customizable"
- From the beginning, Linear had a strong opinion of what a good workflow looks like
- Quality and craft as differentiators, alternative to "move fast and break things"
- Craft = "the human process of shaping something and putting a piece of yourself into the work"

## Opinionated > Configurable
- Linear provides standards and defaults for how to operate
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Encourages consistent team practices
- Narrowed the surface area of choice instead of supporting every possible workflow
- "Being highly opinionated" was the fundamental differentiator

## Performance as a Feature
- Sub-50ms response times vs Jira's 1-2 seconds
- 3.7x faster than Jira in benchmarks
- Local-first architecture was a technical bet that paid off
- Speed isn't a metric to optimize - it's the product experience itself

## Bottom-Up vs Top-Down
- No outbound sales initially
- Product-led growth through network effects
- Individual engineer adopts -> team adopts -> org adopts
- Building in public created pre-launch demand
- 10,000 waitlist without paid marketing

## The Courage to Say No
- Linear doesn't try to solve for all cases
- Opinionated workflow protects user experience
- Trade-off others avoid: narrowing scope instead of expanding it
- Enterprise features added carefully, not desperately

## Hustle Culture Rejection
- Karri rejects Silicon Valley hustle culture
- "People are rushing too much"
- Focus on sustainability and craft over speed of shipping
- Profitable since early on - didn't burn through capital

## Transferable Lessons
1. Performance is a feature, not a metric
2. Opinionated beats configurable in crowded markets
3. Bottom-up adoption requires a product that sells itself
4. Small teams can win with focus and taste
5. Building in public creates demand before launch
6. Saying no to features can be a competitive advantage
7. You don't need a huge team - Linear hit $1.25B with ~70 people
