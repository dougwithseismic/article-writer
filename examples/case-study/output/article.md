# How Linear Redesigned the Issue Tracker and Grew to $10M ARR

*The product decisions, design obsessions, and go-to-market bets that turned a crowded market into a revenue engine*

## The Fastest App Nobody Expected

You click "create issue" and it happens. Not after a spinner. Not after a page reload. Not after a visible network round-trip. It just happens, as though the software anticipated what you wanted before you wanted it. That feeling -- of a tool that keeps pace with your thoughts instead of interrupting them -- is the first thing anyone mentions when they describe using [Linear](https://linear.app) for the first time.

The numbers back up the sensation. Linear consistently achieves sub-50ms response times for creating and updating issues, while Jira -- the entrenched tool it set out to replace -- typically takes one to two seconds for the same operations. That gap is not marginal. It is the difference between a tool that flows with your thinking and a tool that interrupts it. In a [2024 benchmark](https://productlane.com/blog/linear-vs-jira), Linear performed 3.7 times faster than Jira and 2.3 times faster than Asana across common project management tasks. Board views, issue details, and project switching all load in under 100 milliseconds. For developers who switch between their code editor and their issue tracker dozens of times per day, that difference isn't cosmetic. It's structural.

The company behind this experience was founded in 2019 by three engineers who had lived inside broken tools at some of Silicon Valley's most demanding companies. [Karri Saarinen](https://karrisaarinen.com/posts/starting-linear-app/) was a principal designer at Airbnb, where he'd co-created the company's design language system and watched entire product teams struggle with Jira's sluggishness. His frustration ran deep enough that he built a Chrome extension to simplify Jira's interface -- and it spread virally through Airbnb's product organization. Tuomas Artman had earned a reputation as one of Uber's most respected mobile engineers, spending over a decade building sync engines at companies including Groupon and Uber. Jori Lallo had co-founded a Y Combinator startup with Saarinen that was later acquired by Coinbase, where he experienced the same tool frustrations from yet another vantage point.

All three had arrived at the same conclusion independently: the software development process had evolved dramatically over the past decade, but the tools developers used to manage that process had barely changed. [As Sequoia noted](https://sequoiacap.com/article/linear-spotlight/) when they later profiled the company, these founders saw a market where the pain was universal and the incumbent solutions were optimized for the wrong users. Continuous deployment, microservices, modern CI/CD pipelines -- the engineering workflow had been transformed in every dimension except one. The tool at the center of it all, the issue tracker, still felt like software from 2008.

The question they faced was audacious. In a market where Jira commanded over 36% share, where GitHub Issues was free, and where a graveyard of failed challengers served as a warning, how do you convince engineering teams to switch to something new? The answer, as it turned out, was not a better feature set or a longer list of integrations. It was a fundamentally better experience -- one so fast and so thoughtfully crafted that developers couldn't help but tell their colleagues about it. Linear wasn't trying to be the tool with the most features. It was trying to be the tool that disappeared into your workflow, the one that never made you wait or wonder where something was.

## Why the World Didn't Need Another Issue Tracker

To understand what Linear accomplished, you first have to understand the market it entered. In 2019, the project management software landscape wasn't just competitive -- it was ossified. [Jira held 36.57% market share](https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/project-management--217/jira-market-share) in 2020, a dominant position built over more than a decade of enterprise sales. Microsoft Project controlled another 19.78%. Smartsheet, Asana, and Monday.com each held single-digit shares, competing fiercely for whatever Atlassian left behind. The overall market was growing at a 10.67% compound annual rate, but the spoils overwhelmingly went to incumbents with established sales channels and enterprise relationships.

GitHub Issues offered a free, integrated alternative for teams already living in GitHub's ecosystem. Notion and Airtable were attracting tech-savvy users with flexible, database-driven approaches. Clubhouse (later renamed Shortcut) had raised venture capital on a similar pitch of being the developer-friendly Jira alternative. For a new entrant focused specifically on issue tracking for engineering teams, the obvious question was: why would anyone switch? The tools that existed were either free, deeply entrenched, or backed by well-funded competitors who had a head start.

Switching costs in project management software are notoriously high. Teams accumulate years of workflow configurations, integrations with CI/CD pipelines and communication tools, custom automations, and deeply embedded habits around how issues get created, triaged, and resolved. Entire onboarding processes are built around specific tool configurations. Reporting dashboards that executives rely on are tied to particular data structures. Even when engineers despised their tools, the organizational inertia of migration kept them locked in. Previous challengers had learned this the hard way. Building a slightly better version of Jira wasn't enough when "better" didn't clear the switching cost threshold. You needed something dramatically, viscerally better -- different enough that the pain of switching felt smaller than the pain of staying.

But something unusual happened with Linear's launch. When the company announced its private beta, it [accumulated 10,000 signups on its waitlist](https://www.growth-letter.com/p/this-startup-had-10000-people-on) -- an extraordinary number for an issue tracking tool. The demand wasn't manufactured through marketing spend. Saarinen and the team had been building in public on Twitter, sharing design decisions and product philosophy tweet by tweet, and the developer community responded. Stephanie Zhan, a partner at Sequoia Capital, approached the Linear team after discovering that people she trusted in her network were excited about the product. That signal -- organic enthusiasm from engineers, not a top-down sales pitch -- led to a [$4.2 million seed round from Sequoia and Index Ventures](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/linear-lines-up-4-2m-led-by-sequoia-to-build-a-better-platform-for-software-developer-collaboration/) in November 2019.

During the private beta, hundreds of companies signed up, including Pitch, Render, Curology, and a wave of Y Combinator startups. The demand was real, sustained, and coming from exactly the right audience -- engineering teams at fast-moving companies who cared deeply about their tools. The waitlist itself was a piece of product strategy. Linear remained invite-only for nearly a year, onboarding small cohorts of ten to twenty users at a time. The philosophy was deliberate: go slow to go fast. Instead of being overwhelmed by thousands of bug reports and competing feature requests, the team could iterate with focused feedback from users who genuinely cared about the problem.

What made the seed round remarkable wasn't the amount -- $4.2 million is modest by Silicon Valley standards. It was the reasoning behind it. Sequoia wasn't betting on the market being large, because everyone already knew it was large. They were betting on the signal. When thousands of engineers voluntarily sign up for a waitlist to try a new issue tracker -- a category nobody considers exciting -- something fundamental is happening. The pain was deeper than the market analysis suggested, and Linear was the first product that seemed to take that pain seriously.

The market looked impossible. The waitlist suggested otherwise.

## The Problem Hiding in Plain Sight

Jira launched in 2002 as a straightforward bug tracker. Over the following two decades, it evolved into something far more complex -- an enterprise platform capable of modeling virtually any workflow a large organization could imagine. That flexibility was precisely the problem. As [developers on the DEV Community noted](https://dev.to/teamcamp/why-developers-hate-jira-and-10-best-jira-alternatives-1hl1), Jira's hundreds of configuration options created what many described as an "illusion of control" that primarily served managers and process consultants, not the engineers who used the tool most frequently.

The pattern was insidious and nearly universal. Each organization's Jira instance accumulated custom fields, required inputs, workflow steps, and approval processes that individually seemed reasonable but collectively made every interaction slower and more burdensome. A new required field here. An extra approval step there. A custom workflow that someone in operations needed for a quarterly audit. None of these additions were unreasonable on their own, but they compounded over years into a tool that felt hostile to the people who used it most. Teams found themselves spending more time managing their project management tool than actually building software. The interface grew cluttered. Performance degraded under the weight of plugins and custom configurations. Load times, as many engineers bitterly joked, were measured in coffee breaks.

This mattered more than most people realized. Research on developer productivity reveals just how costly slow tools actually are. [Gloria Mark's studies at UC Irvine](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/09/10/developer-flow-state-and-its-impact-on-productivity/) found that it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully refocus after an interruption. A programmer typically needs 10 to 15 minutes to start editing code again after being pulled away. When McKinsey studied developer workdays, they found that engineers spend only 41% of their time in a productive flow state. Interrupted tasks take twice as long to finish and contain twice as many errors. According to research published in Harvard Business Review, knowledge workers need an average of 52 minutes of uninterrupted deep work to reach a state of flow.

Now consider what happens when your issue tracker takes two seconds to load every screen, and you switch between it and your code editor thirty or forty times per day. Each transition isn't just a two-second delay -- it's a potential flow-state disruption. Multiply that across a team of twenty engineers, five days a week, fifty weeks a year. The cumulative cost is staggering, but because it's distributed across thousands of micro-interruptions rather than visible in a single dramatic failure, it remains invisible to the managers and procurement teams who choose the tools. No one puts "our issue tracker costs us 15% of engineering productivity" in a quarterly report, because the cost is diffuse enough to escape measurement.

That invisibility was the insight. Linear's founders hadn't just experienced the pain of slow tools -- they understood why the pain persisted. Enterprise software purchasing decisions are made by people who optimize for different things than the people who actually use the software. Managers and IT departments want configurability, reporting, audit trails, and vendor stability. Engineers want speed, simplicity, and keyboard-driven workflows. The people who chose Jira and the people who used Jira had fundamentally different requirements, and for years, the choosers won.

Saarinen's Chrome extension at Airbnb was a grassroots protest against this dynamic. The fact that it spread virally through the organization -- not because it was mandated, but because engineers genuinely preferred using it -- contained the seed of Linear's entire go-to-market strategy. If you built a tool so good that individual engineers adopted it on their own, you could bypass the procurement process entirely. You didn't need to sell to the CTO. You needed to build something the CTO's engineers would demand.

This was the gap that previous challengers had missed. They tried to compete with Jira on Jira's terms -- more features, better configurability, enterprise sales teams. Linear would compete on entirely different terms. It would be the tool that developers chose for themselves, and it would be so good that the choice would be obvious the moment they touched it.

## Speed as a Feature and Other Bets

Linear's approach wasn't a single insight. It was a series of deliberate, reinforcing bets that most companies in the space would have considered too risky or too opinionated. Three bets defined the company's trajectory.

**The first bet was architectural.** Tuomas Artman's decade of experience building sync engines at Uber and Groupon gave Linear a technical foundation that most startups couldn't replicate. The company built a [local-first sync engine](https://linear.app/now/scaling-the-linear-sync-engine) that stores data on the user's device and renders UI updates before the server even confirms the change. Built on React, MobX, TypeScript, and Node.js with PostgreSQL -- plus what Artman describes as "home-made sync magic" -- this architecture means that clicking a button, creating an issue, or moving a card across a board feels instant because the interface doesn't wait for a network round trip.

The technical implications go beyond speed. The sync engine enables offline functionality, so engineers working on planes or in spotty-wifi offices can keep using the tool without interruption. It enables real-time collaboration, because changes propagate to all connected clients within milliseconds. And it creates a development workflow where [new features can be built without modifying server-side code](https://www.localfirst.fm/15), dramatically accelerating the team's ability to iterate. The architecture was later [reverse-engineered by the developer community](https://marknotfound.com/posts/reverse-engineering-linears-sync-magic/) and endorsed by Artman himself -- a testament to both its elegance and the community's interest in understanding how Linear achieves its performance.

When Loom's engineering team [switched from Jira to Linear in April 2022](https://linear.app/customers), one of the moments that sold them was watching an engineering manager update a ticket during a live Zoom call. The change appeared instantly on every other engineer's screen. In Jira, that kind of real-time sync simply didn't exist. In Linear, it was the default behavior.

**The second bet was philosophical.** Where Jira gave users infinite configurability -- custom workflows, custom fields, custom issue types, custom everything -- [Linear prescribed an opinionated workflow](https://linear.app/method/introduction). The company published what it calls the Linear Method, a set of principles and practices that define how issues should flow through a team. Issues move from Triage to Backlog to In Progress by default. Work is organized into two-week cycles. Three core abstractions -- Roadmaps, Projects, and Cycles -- replace Jira's sprawling taxonomy of epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, and custom issue hierarchies.

Saarinen's reasoning was direct. As he [told the Figma blog](https://www.figma.com/blog/karri-saarinens-10-rules-for-crafting-products-that-stand-out/), you should design something for someone specific, because designing something good for everyone is nearly impossible. The keyboard-first interface reinforced this. Cmd+K opens a global command palette. The slash key filters any view instantly. The E key assigns or moves issues. Every action is accessible without touching a mouse, designed for developers who spend their days in terminals and code editors and resent being forced into point-and-click interfaces.

This opinionated approach was a calculated risk. Enterprise buyers typically want customization, and refusing to provide it seemed like a way to limit the addressable market. But Linear's bet was that the exhaustion with over-configurable tools was so deep that a [streamlined, opinionated alternative](https://medium.com/@aryan1999varma/linear-when-opinionated-products-win-e47e01c80756) would actually feel liberating. Instead of spending the first three weeks configuring your issue tracker, you could start using Linear productively within minutes.

**The third bet was strategic.** Linear chose product-led growth over enterprise sales. There was no outbound sales team in the early years. No demos booked through cold outreach. The [product had to sell itself](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/how-linear-grows). The free tier offered unlimited team members -- a significant departure from competitors who charged per seat. The intention was clear: get the tool into as many hands as possible, let engineers experience the speed and design quality firsthand, and trust that organic word-of-mouth would do what sales development reps could not.

The Twitter account functioned as a public changelog, showing product updates and design decisions in real time. Building in public created a feedback loop: engineers who followed along felt invested in the product before they ever used it. The invite-only beta created exclusivity without artificial scarcity -- the cohorts were small because the team genuinely wanted concentrated feedback, and the byproduct was a sense that Linear was something worth waiting for.

The growth mechanics were powered by network effects. When one engineer on a team adopted Linear, they needed their teammates to collaborate on the same issues. Each new user naturally pulled in others. Unlike top-down enterprise sales, where adoption is mandated, bottom-up growth meant that every user was a genuine advocate -- someone who had chosen the tool because they preferred it.

## From Waitlist to $10M ARR

The milestones tell a story of compounding momentum -- slow at first, then accelerating in a way that made the initial patience look prescient. Linear's 10,000-person waitlist converted into an invite-only beta in late 2019 and early 2020, with the team carefully onboarding small groups while iterating on feedback. This wasn't the typical startup playbook of launching fast and iterating publicly. Linear treated its beta as a workshop, refining the product with the kind of focused attention that would have been impossible with thousands of concurrent users filing bug reports. By 2020, traction was strong enough to raise a [$13 million Series A from Sequoia Capital](https://medium.com/linear-app/linear-raises-13m-in-series-a-funding-from-sequoia-capital-daa0f0c43758), doubling down on the same investor who'd led the seed. The message was clear: Sequoia had seen the early retention data and believed the product had crossed from promising to inevitable.

The product-led growth flywheel began spinning in earnest around 2021 and 2022. Companies didn't just try Linear -- they migrated to it wholesale. [Ramp began building with Linear from day one](https://linear.app/customers) and scaled to over 1,000 employees without ever needing to switch. Loom's engineering team fully migrated from Jira in 2022. Coinbase, Automattic, and Block -- companies with decades of accumulated tooling -- made the switch. By the time Linear's customer list included OpenAI, Cash App, Vercel, Perplexity, Brex, Mercury, Substack, and Supercell, it was clear that the bottom-up adoption pattern was working at scale.

By 2023, [Linear's revenue reached $8.4 million](https://getlatka.com/companies/linear.app). The company raised a [$35 million Series B led by Accel](https://linear.app/now/series-b) in September 2023, with continued participation from Sequoia and 01Advisors. The round valued the company at $400 million -- a number that reflected not just current revenue but the trajectory and retention metrics underneath it.

Then the growth accelerated further. In January 2025, Karri Saarinen [posted a thread marking Linear's sixth birthday](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1880314177165869284) that contained some of the most striking metrics in recent SaaS history. The team was just 70 people. More than 10,000 companies were using Linear to plan and build their products. Enterprise ARR had grown 2,000 percent. The company had signed its first Fortune 100 customer. Net Revenue Retention exceeded 140 percent, meaning existing customers were expanding their usage significantly year over year. Net operating income had grown over 1,400 percent. And perhaps most remarkably, the company was profitable -- not burning through venture capital to sustain growth, but generating more revenue than it spent.

Six months later, in June 2025, [Linear reached $100 million in annual revenue](https://www.runtime.news/linear-ceo-karri-saarinen-our-customer-base-is-quite-powerful/). An [$82 million Series C led by Accel](https://techfundingnews.com/linear-rockets-to-unicorn-status-82m-series-c-fuels-1-25b-valuation-in-jira-showdown/) valued the company at $1.25 billion, granting it unicorn status. Total funding across four rounds reached $134.2 million. The company now served over 14,000 customers, and it had done so with a team that, at the time of its sixth birthday, numbered just 70 people.

That efficiency metric deserves attention. At $1.25 billion in valuation with approximately 100 employees at the time of the Series C, Linear was generating roughly $12.5 million in value per employee. The typical startup creates $1 to $2 million per employee. Linear's ratio wasn't just incrementally better -- it was an order of magnitude better, a direct consequence of the company's philosophy that small, focused teams building with taste and discipline can outperform sprawling organizations. While competitors in the project management space scaled their headcounts into the thousands, Linear proved that restraint could be its own kind of competitive advantage. Fewer people meant fewer coordination costs, faster decision-making, and a product vision that stayed coherent rather than fragmenting across dozens of product teams.

The 140-plus percent Net Revenue Retention is the strongest signal of genuine product-market fit in the entire story. It means that even without acquiring a single new customer, Linear's revenue would grow 40 percent year over year simply from existing customers using more of the product. Customers don't just stay -- they expand. Teams grow. Organizations adopt Linear across more departments. What starts as a single engineering team's experiment becomes a company-wide standard. That kind of organic expansion doesn't happen with a product people tolerate. It happens with a product people champion internally, going to bat for it in tooling discussions and recommending it to friends at other companies.

The journey from $8.4 million in revenue in 2023 to $100 million in June 2025 represents approximately 1,090 percent growth over two years. For a company that built itself on the premise that you don't need aggressive outbound sales to grow, this trajectory validates the core thesis. When the product is genuinely better -- when it respects the user's time, their workflow, and their intelligence -- growth takes care of itself.

## What Linear Teaches Every Product Builder

Linear's story contains lessons that extend well beyond issue trackers. Four of them are especially transferable.

**Performance is a feature, not a metric.** Most companies treat speed as an optimization target -- something you improve with better caching or CDN configuration. Linear treated it as a product decision. By building a [local-first sync engine](https://linear.app/now/scaling-the-linear-sync-engine), they didn't just make the existing paradigm faster; they changed the paradigm. The lesson for any founder entering a market with slow incumbents: don't optimize within the existing architecture. Ask whether a fundamentally different architecture could make speed the defining characteristic of your product.

**Opinionated beats configurable in crowded markets.** Jira's configurability was both its greatest strength and its greatest vulnerability. Linear exploited that vulnerability by offering the opposite: [strong defaults, limited customization, and a prescribed workflow](https://linear.app/method/introduction) that eliminated the configuration overhead teams had come to accept as inevitable. Saarinen has been consistent on this point, telling [First Round Review](https://review.firstround.com/linears-path-to-product-market-fit/) that you cannot build the optimal tool for anything if it's endlessly customizable. In a market saturated with feature-rich competitors, saying no to complexity can be the most powerful differentiation strategy available.

**Bottom-up adoption requires a product that sells itself.** Linear's growth was not driven by a sales team. It was driven by engineers who loved the product and pulled their teammates into it. The free tier with unlimited members, the public changelog on Twitter, the invite-only beta that created organic buzz -- all of these were mechanisms for getting the product into the hands of its actual users rather than its buyers. For founders in markets where the purchaser and the user are different people, this is a playbook worth studying closely. Build for the user. Let the user become your sales force.

**Small teams win with taste.** Perhaps the most counterintuitive lesson from Linear is how few people it took. At its sixth birthday, the company had 70 employees and over 10,000 customers. Karri Saarinen has been vocal about [rejecting Silicon Valley's hustle culture](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-this-1-billion-startup-ceo-rejects-996-hustle-culture/500649), arguing that people are rushing too much and that sustainable craft produces better outcomes than frantic shipping. The company has been profitable since its early days, never relying on venture capital to subsidize growth at the expense of product quality. While other startups burned through hundreds of millions chasing growth at all costs, Linear grew steadily, kept its team small, and invested in quality over quantity. In an industry that often equates headcount with ambition, Linear is proof that a small team with strong opinions and genuine craft can build a billion-dollar company.

The broader takeaway is this: Linear entered one of the most crowded, most dominated, most "boring" categories in enterprise software and built a company worth over a billion dollars. It did so not by out-featuring the competition, not by outspending them on sales and marketing, and not by racing to build the longest feature list. It did so by out-caring about the experience of using the product every single day.

The moat isn't a feature list or an enterprise sales team. The moat is the feeling you get when you use the tool -- that rare sensation that the software was built by people who understand exactly what you need and refuse to compromise on delivering it. That feeling is what makes engineers voluntarily migrate their entire team. It's what drives 140 percent Net Revenue Retention. And it's what turns a two-person prototype into a billion-dollar company.

For any founder staring at a saturated market and wondering whether there's still room, Linear's answer is unambiguous. There is always room for something people genuinely love to use.
