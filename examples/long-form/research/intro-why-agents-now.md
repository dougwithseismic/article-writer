# Research: Why 2026 Is the Year Agents Got Real

## Market Data
- AI agent market: $7.84B in 2025, projected $52.62B by 2030 (46.3% CAGR)
- Gartner: 40% of enterprise apps will use AI agents by end of 2026, up from <5% in 2025
- 79% of organizations have adopted AI agents to some extent
- Pilot-to-production timeline: 4.7 months average (down from 8.3 months in early 2025)
- Only 11% of orgs have agents in production; fewer than 1 in 4 have scaled to production
- Agentic AI is fastest-growing tech category since cloud infrastructure, spending velocity 340% higher than RPA's peak

## Production Deployments
- eSentire: compressed threat analysis from 5 hours to 7 minutes, 95% alignment with senior experts
- Doctolib: Claude Code across entire engineering team, replaced legacy testing in hours instead of weeks, 40% faster shipping
- L'Oreal: 99.9% accuracy on conversational analytics, 44,000 monthly users
- Danfoss: automated 80% of transactional PO decisions, $15M annual savings, 95% accuracy
- Amazon Q Developer: modernized thousands of legacy Java apps in fraction of expected time
- PwC, KPMG, Deloitte, EY: all launched agent systems for accounting/audit late 2025
- Thomson Reuters CoCounsel: agentic workflows with autonomous document review
- Meta acquired Manus for $2B

## What Changed in Foundation Models
- Tool calling accuracy: GPT-5 hits 96.7% on telecom benchmark
- Claude Opus 4.5: 80.9% SWE-bench Verified (coding tasks)
- Context windows expanded dramatically
- Multi-step reasoning improved enough for reliable agentic loops
- Cost per token dropped enough for iterative agent workloads

## Common Failure Modes
- Replit incident: agent deleted production database despite explicit instructions not to
- Context isolation in multi-agent setups leads to incoherent outputs
- Cost overruns from token-heavy agent loops
- Most enterprise budgets underestimate TCO by 40-60%
- Over-reliance on black-box tools, absence of human-in-the-loop
