  "subtitle": "From single-prompt wrappers to multi-agent production systems: the architectures, frameworks, and hard-won lessons shaping how engineers build autonomous AI today",
  "summary": "AI agents have moved from research demos to production infrastructure. This guide walks you through every layer of building agents that actually work in the real world: choosing the right architecture for your use case, selecting frameworks that won't lock you in, designing tool-use patterns that stay reliable at scale, handling memory and state across long-running tasks, and deploying with the observability you need to sleep at night. Drawing on real production systems from companies like Anthropic, LangChain, Cognition, and dozens of startups shipping agent products today, you'll learn what works, what fails, and what the next twelve months look like for agent engineering.",

    "hook": "A single AI agent now handles what used to take a team of engineers a quarter to build. But most agent projects still fail in production, and the gap between demo and deployment is where careers are made.",
    "tension": "The tooling is exploding, the architectures are diverging, and teams are drowning in framework choices. Meanwhile, the agents that actually work in production look nothing like the tutorials suggest.",
    "resolution": "A clear mental model for agent architecture, grounded in real production patterns, lets you cut through the hype and build systems that reliably solve problems at scale.",
    "transformation": "From overwhelmed by agent hype to confidently designing, building, and deploying agent systems that hold up under real-world load"
