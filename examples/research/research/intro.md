# Research Notes: The Productivity Promise Nobody Has Verified

## Headline Productivity Claims

- **GitHub/Microsoft**: 55% faster task completion in controlled experiment with 95 professional developers (P=.0017). Pull request time decreased from 9.6 to 2.4 days. Successful builds increased 84%. [Source: GitHub Blog]
- **Google**: AI now writes over 30% of new code (up from 25% six months prior). Internal RCT showed ~21% faster task completion. [Source: Google Earnings, arXiv]
- **Microsoft**: AI responsible for 20-30% of code in some projects. CEO Satya Nadella confirmed. [Source: Entrepreneur]
- **Amazon CodeWhisperer**: Claims 25-50% productivity gains for infrastructure projects.

## Peer-Reviewed Contradicting Evidence

- **METR 2025 RCT**: 16 experienced developers, 246 tasks, AI tools (Cursor Pro + Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet) resulted in 19% SLOWER completion. Developers believed they were 20% faster — a 39-percentage-point perception gap. [Source: metr.org, arXiv 2507.09089]
- **Systematic Literature Review (2025)**: 37 peer-reviewed studies showed mixed results. Gains in minimized code search and automation of repetitive tasks, but concerns about cognitive offloading, reduced collaboration, inconsistent code quality. [Source: arXiv 2507.03156]

## Methodological Criticisms

- Vendor studies use self-contained tasks that sacrifice realism for scale
- Tasks don't require prior context/familiarity
- Use algorithmic evaluation metrics missing important capabilities
- Developer self-reports unreliable: 39-point perception gap demonstrated by METR
- Time-to-completion on isolated tasks is poor proxy for engineering productivity

## Adoption Rates

- **Stack Overflow 2025**: 84% using or planning to use AI tools (up from 76% in 2024). 51% daily use.
- **Trust declining**: Only 29% trust accuracy (down from 40%). 46% actively distrust.
- **Positive sentiment**: Dropped from 70%+ (2023-2024) to 60% (2025).
- **Biggest frustration**: 66% cite "almost right but not quite" AI solutions.

## Key Data Points for Opening
- GitHub Copilot now generates 46% of code in files where enabled
- 88% of Copilot-generated code stays in final version
- 15 million developers using Copilot
- Yet controlled studies show 19% slowdown for experienced devs
