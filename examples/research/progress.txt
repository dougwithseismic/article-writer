Article Pipeline Progress Log
=============================

Phase 1: RESEARCH - COMPLETE
- Conducted 25+ web searches across all 8 sections
- Found 40+ unique sources: academic papers, industry reports, vendor studies, case studies
- Created research notes for each section: intro, measurement-landscape, code-generation, debugging-maintenance, documentation-knowledge, hidden-costs, organizational-patterns, conclusion
- Created comprehensive sources.json with 42 categorized sources
- Key findings: METR 19% slowdown vs GitHub 55% speedup creates core narrative tension
- All sections marked research_complete: true

Phase 2: OUTLINE - COMPLETE
- Detailed section-by-section outline written to outline.md
- Narrative arc: hook -> context -> foundation -> deep-dive x3 -> analysis -> conclusion
- Each section mapped to specific research notes and data points

Phase 3: WRITE - COMPLETE
- Full article written to output/article.md
- 8,012 total words (target: 8,000, minimum: 6,000)
- 8 sections, all above 700-word minimum
- 87 inline links (55 unique URLs), target was 40
- 17 named organizations with specific case study data
- 100% prose ratio (zero bullet points), target was 75%
- All headers conversational, no colons

Phase 4: REVIEW - COMPLETE
- Verified all major claims have inline citations
- Confirmed narrative flow from hook through conclusion
- Checked that both positive and negative evidence presented fairly
- Verified real-world examples include specific data points, not just name-drops

Phase 5: EVAL - COMPLETE
- All quality gates PASS
- eval-result.json written with detailed metrics
- article.json status updated to "reviewed"

Key Learnings:
- The METR vs vendor study contrast provides strong narrative anchor
- Atlassian DevEx 2025 report was an unexpectedly rich source (10hr savings + 10hr friction paradox)
- GitClear longitudinal data (211M lines) provides most compelling code quality evidence
- Booking.com + Palo Alto Networks provide best organizational case studies
- Veracode security data (45% vulnerability rate, 100+ LLMs) is the strongest hidden cost evidence
