Date: 2026-02-06

PHASE 1: RESEARCH [COMPLETE]
- Conducted 12 web searches across all 7 sections
- Covered: SSE vs WebSocket comparisons, Next.js 15 streaming patterns, Drizzle ORM setup,
  EventSource API, Recharts real-time data, deployment platforms, authentication, LISTEN/NOTIFY
- Wrote research notes for all 7 sections to research/*.md
- Created sources.json with 37 tracked sources
- All sections marked research_complete: true

PHASE 2: OUTLINE [COMPLETE]
- Wrote detailed outline to outline.md covering narrative arc, section breakdown,
  code examples to include, and transitions between sections

PHASE 3: WRITE [COMPLETE]
- Wrote all 7 sections with full code examples
- Section word counts: 562, 503, 795, 775, 1288, 1214, 551
- Total: 5,688 words (target: 5,000, minimum: 3,000)
- All sections meet minimum word requirements
- 24 code blocks, 44 external links, 11 real-world examples
- Expanded prerequisites section from 291 to 503 words to meet 400-word minimum

PHASE 4: REVIEW [COMPLETE]
