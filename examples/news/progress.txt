Topic: Deno Deploy Goes GA and Bets Big on Sandboxing AI-Generated Code
Date: 2026-02-06
Status: REVIEWED - All quality gates passed

## Adaptation Note

The original article.json specified a fictional "Deno 3.0" launch. Research revealed that no
Deno 3.0 exists. The article was adapted to cover the real, breaking news from this week:

1. Deno Deploy reached General Availability (February 3, 2026)
2. Deno Sandbox launched in beta (February 3, 2026) - Firecracker microVMs for AI code
3. Deno 2.6 shipped in December 2025 with dx, tsgo, deno audit

This is a stronger article because it covers verified, current events rather than speculation.

## Pipeline Execution

### Phase 1: Research
- Executed 11 web searches across all 4 sections
- Found 26 sources (official Deno blog, InfoWorld, Stack Overflow, dev.to, etc.)
- Verified all major claims against official Deno announcements
- Research notes written for all 4 sections in examples/news/research/
- sources.json created with 26 entries

### Phase 2: Writing
- All 4 sections written in inverted pyramid structure
- Most newsworthy info (Sandbox + Deploy GA) leads the article
- 2 code samples included (bash CLI commands, TypeScript edge function)
- 22 external links with citations throughout
- 6 real-world examples (Netlify, Supabase, Anthropic/Bun, AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, Ryan Dahl)
- Zero bullet points - 100% prose outside code blocks

### Phase 3: Review
- Narrative flow verified: hook -> details -> impact -> outlook
- Transitions between sections are smooth
- No consecutive bullet points (none exist)
- Headers are conversational, no colons
- Active voice, second person where appropriate
- All claims cited with links

### Phase 4: Evaluation
- Total words: 1,558 (target: 1,500, minimum: 800) -- PASS
- External links: 22 (target: 8) -- PASS
- Code samples: 2 (target: 2) -- PASS
- Real examples: 6 (target: 3) -- PASS
- Prose ratio: 100% (target: 80%) -- PASS
- All sections above 200-word minimum -- PASS
- All sections have 2+ links -- PASS

## Key Learnings

- The Deno ecosystem is moving fast in early 2026. Deploy GA and Sandbox are the headline news.
- Anthropic's acquisition of Bun (December 2025) created an interesting competitive dynamic
  where runtimes are now explicitly positioning around AI infrastructure.
- Deno's 3.5% market share (Stack Overflow 2025) vs Node's ~50% shows the adoption gap remains
  large, but the platform play (Deploy + Sandbox + KV) differentiates from pure runtime competition.
- The article was strengthened by covering real events rather than the fictional Deno 3.0 spec,
  since readers can verify every claim against published sources.
