  "subtitle": "Native cloud deploy, a built-in AI SDK, and zero-config TypeScript make Deno's biggest release a direct challenge to Node.js dominance",
  "summary": "Deno 3.0 launched today with three headline features: Deno Deploy baked directly into the runtime, a first-party AI SDK for building LLM-powered applications, and a revamped permissions model that simplifies the developer experience. The release signals Ryan Dahl's most aggressive move yet to pull production workloads away from Node.js and positions Deno as a full-stack platform rather than just a runtime.",
