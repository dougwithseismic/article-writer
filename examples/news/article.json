  "subtitle": "General availability, Firecracker-powered microVMs for untrusted code, and a runtime that keeps pulling ahead on security",
  "summary": "Deno Deploy reached general availability on February 3, 2026, alongside the beta launch of Deno Sandbox, a Firecracker-powered microVM environment designed to safely execute AI-generated code. Combined with Deno 2.6's supply chain security features and the runtime's growing adoption by Netlify and Supabase, these releases mark Deno's clearest pitch yet as a full platform rather than just a Node.js alternative.",
