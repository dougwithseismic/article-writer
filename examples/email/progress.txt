Date: 2026-02-06

--- RESEARCH PHASE ---
[DONE] Ran 8 web searches across AI dev tools, code review, local models, testing, benchmarks
[DONE] Found 16 unique sources across 9 domains
[DONE] Identified 5 tools to feature: Qodo 2.0, Ollama v0.15.3, Goose by Block, CodeRabbit, mabl
[DONE] Research notes written for all 3 sections (opener, picks, closing)
[DONE] sources.json created with 16 entries

Key research decisions:
- Led with Qodo 2.0 as the biggest release (launched Feb 4, multi-agent code review)
- Ollama v0.15.3 chosen as the actionable CTA pick (free, zero-config, shipped Feb 1)
- Goose by Block included for open-source angle (26k+ GitHub stars, Apache 2.0)
- CodeRabbit for the "free for OSS" angle
- mabl for the testing category gap
