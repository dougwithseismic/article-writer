  "title": "Why Most Developer Productivity Tools Make Teams Slower",
  "subtitle": "The uncomfortable truth about the $45 billion productivity tool industry and why adding more software to your stack is quietly destroying your team's output",
  "summary": "Engineering leaders keep buying tools that promise 10x productivity, yet developer satisfaction surveys show teams feel slower than ever. The problem isn't bad tools—it's the fundamental assumption that developer bottlenecks are tooling problems. Most of what slows teams down is context switching, unclear requirements, and meeting overload. Throwing another dashboard at those problems just adds one more tab to manage. This piece argues that the most productive teams aren't the ones with the best tools—they're the ones with the fewest.",
  "thesis": "The developer productivity tool industry has created a perverse incentive loop: each tool promises to solve the problems created by the last tool, while the real bottlenecks—context switching, unclear ownership, and decision fatigue—remain untouched. Teams that ruthlessly subtract tools outperform those that keep adding them.",

Close with the provocation that the most productive thing most engineering leaders could do tomorrow isn't buy a new tool—it's cancel a subscription.
