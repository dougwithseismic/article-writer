# Research: Why We Keep Buying Anyway

## Key Findings

### Market Size and Incentives
- Software development tools market: $7.47 billion in 2025, projected $8.78B in 2026
- Broader productivity software market: $77.85 billion in 2024
- GitHub Copilot revenue jumped to $400M in 2025, a 248% year-on-year rise
- Growth rate of dev tools: 16-17% CAGR

### Developer Satisfaction Research
- Top drivers of satisfaction: "autonomy and trust," "competitive pay," "solving real-world problems" (Stack Overflow 2025)
- Over 49,000 developers surveyed
- "Reputation for quality" and "robust API" rank far higher than "AI integration" for tool selection
- AI integration came in second-to-last for importance
- Autonomy importance scales with experience

### Basecamp/37signals Tool Minimalism
- Built around premise that "most project management software creates more problems than it solves"
- Six essential tools vs. competitors piling on features
- "Constraints create focus"
- "Managing less means accomplishing more"
- Company focused entirely on flagship product, stripped everything else
- "Minimal dependencies, maximum productivity" - staying vanilla pays dividends

### The Cargo Cult Dynamic
- Spotify model widely copied but often misunderstood
- Spotify allows squads to pick own tools; standardization through organic adoption, not mandate
- Companies copy tool choices without copying the culture and autonomy
- McKinsey found top-quartile DX companies outperform peers in revenue by up to 50%
- But the DX advantage comes from clear goals and psychological safety, not specific tools

### The Demo vs. Reality Gap
- METR study: devs predicted 24% faster with AI; actually 19% slower
- 45% of respondents say debugging AI-generated code is time-consuming
- Stack Overflow 2025: trust in AI at all-time low
- Tools always look amazing in demos, fatigue sets in by month six

## Real-World Examples
1. 37signals/Basecamp: deliberate tool minimalism, 6 essential tools, profitable for 20+ years
2. GitHub Copilot: $400M revenue but METR study shows experienced devs slower
3. Spotify: organic tool adoption through squad autonomy, not top-down tool mandates
4. Stack Overflow 2025 survey: 49,000+ devs say autonomy matters more than tools
