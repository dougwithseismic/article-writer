# Research: The Slowest Teams Have the Best Tools

## Key Findings

### Tool Sprawl Statistics
- Average company uses 106 SaaS apps (2024), down from 112 in 2023 (BetterCloud)
- Large enterprises (5000+ employees) average 131 apps; broader portfolio averages 275 apps per company
- 53% of SaaS applications go unused in any given 30-day period, equating to $21M in waste annually (Zylo)

### DORA 2024 Report Findings
- AI adoption may negatively impact delivery: estimated 1.5% decrease in delivery throughput and 7.2% reduction in delivery stability
- Internal development platforms improve individual productivity and team performance, but can sometimes slow overall throughput
- Survey of 39,000+ professionals globally

### Teams Slowing Down After Adding Tools
- Engineering teams scaling beyond 50 developers see features that used to take 2 weeks now take 2 months
- The traditional approach of adding more processes, hiring more managers, and buying better tools is "exactly backwards"
- Need less complexity, not more (FullScale.io)

### METR Study on AI Tools
- Experienced developers take 19% LONGER when using AI coding tools (METR, July 2025)
- Developers predicted AI would reduce completion time by 24%; actual result was 19% slower
- Developers accepted less than 44% of AI-generated code
- Study: 16 experienced devs, 246 real issues, randomized controlled trial

### Contrast: Small Teams with Minimal Tooling
- 37signals (Basecamp/HEY) builds products with ~80 people, minimal tooling
- Their philosophy: "companies that claim they can do everything actually excel at nothing"
- Focus on "minimal dependencies, maximum productivity"

## Real-World Examples
1. METR study showing AI tools slowed experienced open-source developers by 19%
2. 37signals building Basecamp + HEY with deliberately minimal toolstack
3. DORA 2024 report finding AI adoption decreased delivery throughput
