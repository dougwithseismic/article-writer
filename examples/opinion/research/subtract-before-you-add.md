### Shopify Calendar/Meeting Purge
- January 2023: cancelled ALL recurring meetings of 3+ people
- Deleted needless Slack channels
- Reinstated "no meeting Wednesdays"
- 50+ person meetings limited to Thursday window only
- 12,000 events eliminated immediately; 322,000 hours of meetings cut in January
- By March: 25% more projects tracked toward completion

### SaaS Audit Case Studies
- One founder discovered $32,736 spent on unused tools in a single year
- 19 paid subscriptions unused for months, several on auto-renewing annual contracts
- 53% of SaaS apps unused in any 30-day period
- Average $21M in annual SaaS waste per company
- Consolidation rate dropped from 14% to 5% - companies aren't auditing enough

### Tool Audit Frameworks
- Decentralized purchasing: sales, marketing, engineering buy tools independently with corporate cards
- IT/Finance often discover subscriptions only at renewal
- Key steps: identify all subscriptions, measure usage, cancel unused, downgrade overprovisioned
- $2M annual savings from comprehensive operational audit at one $5M SaaS company

### The Subtraction Principle
- 37signals: "constraints create focus"
- Spotify: organic tool adoption, not mandated proliferation
- McKinsey: standardization (fewer tools, better integrated) beats proliferation
- DORA: user-centric platforms beat sprawling toolchains

### What Actually Makes Developers Productive
- Autonomy and trust (Stack Overflow 2025, #1 factor)
- Clear goals and psychological safety (ACM Queue DevEx research)
- Deep work time (Gloria Mark: attention spans at 47 seconds)
- Fewer interruptions (Microsoft: 275/day currently)

## Real-World Examples
1. Shopify: 322,000 hours of meetings deleted, 25% more projects completed
2. SaaS founder audit: $32,736 saved from unused tools in one year
