# Research: The Tool Tax Nobody Measures

## Key Findings

### Gloria Mark's Context Switching Research
- Takes average 23 minutes 15 seconds to regain deep focus after interruption
- In 2004: average focus on a screen was 2.5 minutes before switching tasks
- By 2012: shrunk to 75 seconds
- More recently: just 47 seconds (attention fragmentation)
- Workers switched contexts every 10.5 minutes; can't achieve flow
- Getting sidetracked cost 25 minutes before returning to original task, encountering 2.3 other tasks in between

### Microsoft Research on Interruptions
- Employees interrupted every 2 minutes by meetings, email, or notifications
- Up to 275 interruptions per day
- Average worker receives 153 Teams messages per weekday
- 80% of workers report lacking time or energy to do their job effectively
- Brief interruptions double likelihood of mistakes on complex tasks
- Productivity highest when checking email on own schedule vs. notification-driven

### Developer Time Allocation
- Developers on high AI adoption teams touch 9% more tasks and 47% more pull requests per day
- But METR study shows experienced devs are 19% slower with AI tools
- JetBrains 2025: Docker went from popular to near-universal (+17pp)
- Stack Overflow 2025: Trust in AI at all-time low among developers

### Tool Debt Concept
- Average company holds 275 applications in portfolio
- 53% of SaaS apps go unused in 30-day periods
- $21M average annual waste from unused SaaS
- Companies with 5000+ employees average 131 SaaS apps
- Consolidation rate dropped from 14% to 5% year-over-year

### Notification Overload
- Microsoft 365 users interrupted every 2 minutes
- By 11am (peak productivity), real-time messages, meetings, and app switching make focus impossible
- Each tool adds another notification channel, another tab, another context switch

## Real-World Examples
1. Microsoft telemetry: 275 daily interruptions per knowledge worker
2. Gloria Mark's research: attention spans shrunk from 2.5 minutes to 47 seconds
3. Average enterprise: 275 apps in portfolio, 53% unused
