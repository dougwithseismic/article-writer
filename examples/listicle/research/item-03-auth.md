# Research: Keycloak - Authentication

## Key Facts
- Open source IAM backed by Red Hat
- Supports OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML
- Features: SSO, social login, RBAC, MFA, passkeys, user federation
- Keycloak 26.5.2 released Jan 2026
- FAPI 2.0 standard support in v26.4
- Auth0 entry-level: $35-$150/month for 500 users; Keycloak: free (self-hosted)
- Phase Two offers managed Keycloak hosting
- CNCF project

## Trade-offs
- Operational overhead: updates, backups, scaling, security patches
- Configuration UI can feel overwhelming for small teams
- Performance can lag at scale without optimization
- Steeper learning curve than Auth0
