## 2025-2026 Status Change
- Community edition entered maintenance mode late 2025
- No new features or PRs accepted for community edition
- Commercial AIStor product is the focus going forward
- Alternatives emerging: RustFS, SeaweedFS, Garage

## Trade-offs
- Maintenance mode is a red flag for new adopters
- AGPLv3 license has implications for commercial use
- Commercial offering (AIStor) is not free
- Consider alternatives like SeaweedFS or Garage for new projects
