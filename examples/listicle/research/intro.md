## Key Data Points
- Companies spend $1,000-$3,500/year per employee on SaaS applications
- A 50-person startup can save $70,000-$330,000/year by switching to self-hosted open source
- One developer cut over EUR 150/month just by self-hosting 5 tools
- Equity-backed startups spend 107% of ARR on operations
- Seed-stage firms pour 20-40% of revenue into marketing alone
- The median pre-seed round is ~$700K, seed is $500K-$3M

## Framing
- Open-source alternatives now exist for nearly every SaaS category
- Many are production-ready, battle-tested, backed by thriving communities
- Self-hosting starts with sensitive data (logs, analytics) and expands from there
- Not everything needs to be self-hosted — managed open-source options exist
