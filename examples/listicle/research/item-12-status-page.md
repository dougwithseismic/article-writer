# Research: Upptime - Status Page/Monitoring

## Key Facts
- 16K+ GitHub stars
- Powered entirely by GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages
- Zero-server architecture: no external infrastructure needed
- Completely free (if you already use GitHub)
- Scheduled checks every 5 minutes via GitHub Actions
- Automatic incident management via GitHub Issues
- Status page built with Svelte, hosted on GitHub Pages
- Response time data committed to git for historical trends
- Notifications: Slack, Telegram, Discord, Email, SMS
- Created by Anand Chowdhary

## Trade-offs
- Dependent on GitHub Actions availability
- 5-minute minimum check interval (vs seconds for Datadog Synthetics)
- No advanced synthetic monitoring (API chaining, browser tests)
- Public repos needed for free GitHub Actions minutes
