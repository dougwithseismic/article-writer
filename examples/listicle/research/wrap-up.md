# Research: Wrap-Up

## Key Points
- A 50-person startup can save $70K-$330K/year switching to open source
- Start with 2-3 tools, not all 12 at once
- Begin with sensitive data areas: analytics, auth, observability
- Managed open-source options exist for most tools (PostHog Cloud, Strapi Cloud, SigNoz Cloud, Phase Two for Keycloak)
- Self-hosting is best when: you have DevOps capacity, data sovereignty matters, costs at scale are prohibitive
- Managed is best when: team is small, DevOps capacity is limited, time-to-deploy matters most
